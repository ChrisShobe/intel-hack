with real part = x and imaginary part = y
Rectangular form: z = x + j y
Polar form: z = 𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋= 𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓

Prelab assignment #1: verify 
the equivalency of rectangular 
and polar forms
A complex number can be represented 
as a point on a plane, called the Complex 
Plane. The line from the origin of the 
plane to that point is similar to a 2D 
vector, with x and y components. 
Therefore, as in 2D vectors, a complex 
number can be expressed in Cartesian 
(rectangular) or polar form.

2 complex numbers
z = (3 + j4)/(1 – j2)
Prelab assignment #3: compute z as a single complex number 
in rectangular and polar forms. Indicate in which quadrant the 
number resides.
